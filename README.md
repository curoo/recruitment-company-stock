### Exercise

This is a skeleton application to get you up and running quickly.
We are _not_ testing if you get this done or not, but how you work and how you communicate.

Feel free to use all the tools you are used to, including Google, CoPilot, github, etc.

### Company Stock

Expend has been a contracted to create a micro-frontend to display some information about a company stocks, and the sentiment of the news stories about them.

The developer assigned to this task has left due to a family emergency, and unfortunately we need to get this done as soon as possible in his absence.

To make sure we can deliver this you have been assigned a junior dev to help you, and the manager will be in your pairing session if you have anything you need to clarify.

- Read through the ticket [TASK-420](./TASK-420/user-story.md)
- Touch base with the manager to make sure you understand the requirements
- Explain the plan of action to the other developer
- Get stuck in and start coding!
